                    Speculation within the Art world: it is showed how speculation makes the object something insignificant. And how it loses its true value by converting it only into speculative objects. As well as, being stripped of their natural beauty, criticism and meaning. Together with being able to reach large sums of money due to the action of greed and speculation, hence displacing to one side, its true cultural value.

                    Pre-Merge Carbon Footprint: Human being greed shows no limits. And this is reflected as a parasite interaction within biodiversity and this artwork. Dealing with the environmental damage caused during the last years (pre-merge) before the change from PoW to PoS.

                    Bubble consists of 10 original and unique NFTs. These NFTs are recreations of scenes, where persistent symbiosis occurs between different organisms of imaginary species. These species give rise to examples of symbiotic mutualism, increasing their biological fitness (survival capacity). Mutualism describes the ecological interaction between two or more species, where each species has a net benefit. Mutualism is a common type of ecological interaction. These symbiosis scenes represent the opposite of human being interaction within biodiversity.

                    Bubble is an NFT collection where 10% of the benefits will go for reforestation to help inherited carbon footprint offset. These benefits will be allocated to the sustainable initiative called El Bosque de los Zaragozanos.

                <p className="py-4">
                    Furthermore, Bubble is a collection where no participant suffers losses, the only penalty that a speculative participant can suffer is ending up being the collector of a piece of art.

                    The Bubble collection consists of 10 NFTs made up of unique and original images. At any given time, there will be just one NFT for sale and its price will be showed under its bottom side. Until that NFT is sold, no other one will be for sale and, therefore, no other one can be acquired.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    The price of the 10 NFTs will vary, increasing by 10%, each time a sale is completed.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    Thus, the first will be sold for 0.05 ETH, the second for 0.05 ETH + 10% (0.005) ETH = 0.055 ETH, the third for 0.055 ETH + 10% (0.0055) ETH = 0.0605 ETH and so on... Below, the table shows the amounts that each NFT will cost depending on the stage of its sale.

                <p className="py-4">
                    It must be considered that the transaction expenses in the blockchain (gas fee) must be added to all these amounts. Together with that these gas fees are variable, depending on the moment in which the transaction is made and other factors.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    In addition, it must be added a 10% of Royalties that will be allocated to "El Bosque de los Zaragozanos”. This is as compensation for the inherited carbon footprint as it was mentioned previously. FYI, below, you will find an example of the selling of Bubble#3 in round 2. The diagram shows the amounts. The marketplace (www.bubblemarketplace.com) does not charge any type of commission for Bubble transactions. It is free.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    Once the 10 NFTs are sold, their resale will restart. This new sale will be carried out in the same order as the initial one. Besides, each NFT cannot be sold/purchased until the predecessor NFT have been acquired again. Every time an NFT is resold, the previous owner has the obligation to sell it.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    The sale price of the NFT will be close to a price of 159% higher than the purchase value. The price will be calculated automatically, and the transaction will be carried out autonomously. No player/user will be able to keep ownership of the NFT while the game continues and there is another player/user who is willing to purchase.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    Bellow, a diagram shows an example of the (Bubble#3) NFT sale during the second round:
                </p>
                <img src="/venta_NFTs_ingles.jpg" alt="venta_NFTs_ingles" className="py-10 px-10 mx-auto " />
                <p className="py-4">
                    This process will continue until at a time unknown to everyone and determined by an external oracle [1], the game crashes and ends.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    At this stage, all players/users of the game, will become the owners of the NFT that they have acquired at that moment. No further transactions will be allowed through any Marketplace for a specific and limited time of 481 days [2]. Therefore, NFTs will be blocked, preventing transactions. After that period, all NFTs will be unblocked, and the owners will be able to sell them as common NFTs on any marketplace. As well as the NFTs can be kept due to their cultural value. At this point it must be considered that the NFTs have achieved their goal by helping the environment.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    Related to the previous example, the situation will be as it shows the following diagram:
                </p>
                <img src="/Bloqueo_NFTs_ingles.jpg" alt="Bloqueo_NFTs_ingles" className="py-10 px-10 mx-auto " />
                <p className="py-4">
                    When the blockade occurs, the game will be ended and all NFTs will be awarded to the users / players who have them in possession at that time. Moreover, the blockade will begin preventing their sale for a period of 481 days.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    Users who have not achieved NFT ownership, they can withdraw the obtained funds by connecting their Metamask wallet to <a href="http://bubblemarketplace.com" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">www.bubblemarketplace.com</a> by directly clicking the "Withdraw" button. Automatically, the deposited amount will be transferred to a non-Bubble wallet. It is very important to use the same wallet with the purchase was made, since it is the only way in which the program can refund the amount.
                </p>
                <p className="py-4">
                    This operation can be carried out from the moment in which users / players have lost NFT ownership until the disappearance of the Marketplace <a href="http://bubblemarketplace.com" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">(www.bubblemarketplace.com)</a> which is estimated in April 2025.

                <p className="py-4">[1] The oracle will not be invoked during the first 90 days operation of the game. This will be counted from the first sale. Subsequently, it will be invoked, and all sales can be blocked in two different ways. One option is through calls that will be realised to the oracle on day 130, and on day 170 during the game (both with a probability of 10%). Another option is by calls that will be made every 5 sales (10% probability too). In case of the block has not occurred in any of the two previous ways, the game will be automatically blocked after 210 days of operation counted from the first sale.</p>
                <p className="py-4">[2] The blocking time is 481 days, which is the time it takes for a 40-years-old Pinus Halepensis (at a rate of 160 kg of CO2/year [3]) to eliminate its carbon footprint (211 kg of CO2). This data (211kg of CO2) refers to the carbon footprint that an average NFT produced in Ethereum, before The Merge throughout its life, as it was estimated by Memo Akten in 2021.</p>
